    <h2>Unit 2 - Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <script>
        //a variable is an object. an object is a container that holds data and can be used.

        //1. define a variable and we 2. assign a value

        let firstName; //defines a variable
        //scope: global = you can use it and see it anywhere on this page. Including within a function

        console.log(firstName);

        let lastName = "Smith"; //define a variable, assign it a value, data type of string

        firstName = "Mary"; //assign a value, data type string


    </script>
    <p>The value of firstName is
        <script>document.write(firstName);</script>
    </p>
    <p>The value of lastName is
        <script>document.write(lastName);</script>
    </p>
    <script>
        //let firstName = "Jeff"; //define a variable a second time
        firstName = "Jeff"; //change the value of a variable


    </script>

    <p>2. The value of firstName is
        <script>document.write(firstName);</script>
    </p>
    <p>2. The value of lastName is
        <script>document.write(lastName);</script>
    </p>

    <script>
        firstName = 42; //assign a new value of number datatype. The variable does not care what type of datatype is used, even if it's been used for another before. Called "lack of data integrity"
    </script>

    <p>3. The value of firstName is
        <script>document.write(firstName);</script>
    </p>
    <p>3. The value of lastName is
        <script>document.write(lastName);</script>
    </p>
    <script>
        firstName = "42"; //string datatype bcause of the quotes

        //' ' or " " creates a String data type, string literal-exactly as written
    </script>

    <p>4. The value of firstName is
        <script>document.write(firstName);</script>
    </p>
    <p>4. The value of lastName is
        <script>document.write(lastName);</script>
    </p>

    <p>5. The value of firstName is
        <script>document.write("firstName");</script>
    </p>
    <p>5. The value of lastName is
        <script>document.write("lastName");</script>
    </p>
    <script>
//boolean has two values. boolean true and boolean false. boolean variables is a yes/no conditiona/question/flag/switch

        let validForm = true; //boolean variable, boolean data type

console.log(validForm);
    </script>

    <p>Is the form finished? <script>document.write(validForm);</script></p>

<script>
// const - defines a variable with a CONSTANT value, cannot change the value
// often written in all UPPERCASE. Best Practices

const SCHOOLNAME = "Drake"; //constant, global scope, String data type

console.log(SCHOOLNAME);
</script>
<p>School Name: <script>document.write(SCHOOLNAME);</script></p>
<script>

SCHOOLNAME = "UNI";
console.log(SCHOOLNAME); //VSS won't catch the const, but the browser will not like it
</script>


<script>
//dynamic pages/content changes with each person, structure remains the same

let name = "";
let school = "";

</script>
