  <h3>Instructions: </h3>
  <p>Please complete the following exercises using Javascript loops as indicated. Please place your code on this page.
    Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>

  <p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line.</p>
  <p id="answer1"></p>
  <script>question1(); //runtime script to run question1 function automatically as page loads</script>


  <p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>
  <p id="answer2"></p>
  <script>question2();</script>


  <p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>
  <p id="answer3"></p>
  <script>question3();</script>

  <p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>
  <p id="answer4"></p>
  <script>question4();</script>

  <p>5. Create a loop that will print out 6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options
    within the drop down menu below.</p>
  <p>
    <label>Select an Option!
      <select name="select" id="select">
      </select>
    </label>
    <script>question5();</script>
  </p>
