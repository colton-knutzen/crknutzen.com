let schoolName; //1. defines the variable schoolName, but doesn't have a value
console.log(schoolName); //1. displays variable in console, but since there is no value it's undefined

schoolName = "DMACC"; //2. DMACC has been assigned as the value for schoolName. This is a string data type
console.log(schoolName); //2. schoolName shows in the console now as the value of DMACC

schoolName = 42; //3. schoolName has been changed to the value of 42. This is a number data type
console.log(schoolName); //3. schoolName now shows in the console as the value of 42

let courseName = ("WDV221 Intro to Javascript"); //4. courseName has been defined with a string value

let testScore = (100.00); //5. testScore has been assigned a number value
console.log(testScore); //5. testScore value has been output to the console

let courseGrade = (88.65); //6. courseGrade has been assigned a number value
console.log(courseGrade); //6. courseGrade value has been output to the console


let courseCompleted = (false); //7. courseCompleted has been assigned a false value as a boolean data type
console.log(courseCompleted); //7. the boolean courseCompleted has been output to the console

courseCompleted = ("false"); //8. courseCompleted had it's value changed to "false" as a string data type
console.log(courseCompleted); //8. courseCompleted has been output to the console as a string data type

let stringType = ("Java is not the same as javaScript") //9. stringType has been defined with a string data type
console.log(stringType); //9. stringType has been output to the console

let numberType = (1,000,000) //10. numberType has been assigned with a number data type. Curious to how these data types handle , . It viewed it as a 0.
console.log(numberType); //10. numberType has been output to the console

//let numberType2 = (1.000.000) //Extra. numberType has been assigned with a number data type. Curious to how these data types handle . since some of the world uses . instead of , to break up large numbers. Commenting this out because it actually broke all the other javaScript. This raises the question, how is coding in other languages? Is it universally in english with the same westerns stypes of writing?
//console.log(numberTyp2e); //Extra. numberType has been output to the console
