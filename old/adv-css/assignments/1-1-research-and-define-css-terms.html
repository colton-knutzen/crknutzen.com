        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Specificity happens when two or more CSS rules Select the same element, and those two rules must 'fight'
            each other to determine which rule wins and is rendered by the DOM. There is a class and point ranking
            system that happens in the background to determin the winner. Ranking from highest to lowest score there is:
            Inline styles, IDs, Classes, pseudo-classes, & attribute seletors, and Elements & pseudo-elements.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Precedence</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Precedence acts as a tie breaker when Specificity has the same ranking. Precedence states the winner is
            whichever conflicting rule is closest to the element.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        </p>

        <p>
            Inheritance happens when a child element Inherits a CSS rule from the parent. This page for example, I've
            given the body element a background of cadetblue, but I'm writing my answers in an Article element. Because
            I haven't given the article element a conflicting rule, it inherits the cadetblue background from the body.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Property</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            A property is what assigns a style or behvaior to an HTML element. The property 'background-color' is
            assigned to the body of the page and tells the browers that a color change has been requested.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Value</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Value is the piece that immediatly follows the Property. In the example of background-color, the value is
            cadetblue telling the browers the exact value, or color in this case, it's supposed to display.
        </p>


        <p>
        <h2>Selector</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            A selector is exactly what it sounds like; it selects. It is the first piece of CSS. It's the target. It
            tells the browers exactly what element the following property and value is supposed to effect.
