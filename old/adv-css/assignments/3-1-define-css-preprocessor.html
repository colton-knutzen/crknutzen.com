        <h2>What does a CSS Preprocessor do?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            A CSS preprocessor takes their own syntax, which is usually simplier or more efficient, and converts it into CSS document that can be used by the browser.
        </p>

        <h2>What are the advantages of using a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            They allow you to reduce some of the clutter that traditional CSS has. Allows you to write "less" code, saving time and being more effcient. And easier to make changes and troubleshoot
            since there will be less code to shift through and more universal variables.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>What are the disadvantages or issues you need to consider when using a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
        </p>

        <p>
            Like with adding any new tool, there could be issues with the translation, or the coder is unable to write it in a way that the Preprocessor is able to covert it to CSS in a way
            that the developer intends.

        <p>
        <h2>List at least Three CSS Preprocessors currently available.</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sass, LESS, Stylus
