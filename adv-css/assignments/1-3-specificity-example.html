    <header id="header">
        <h1>1-3: Create a CSS Specificity Example</h1>
        <p>The header element has been given and ID, which makes it higher than the body specificty causing the background to change</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        This section has changed background color not because of Specificity, but because the main css rule is closer to the code.
        <article>
                The article section is cadetblue, because it's a group selector of has two element selectors, giving it a value of 0,0,2. Which is higher than the body selector of 0,0,1.
        </article>

        <article>
            <div class="class">
                This section of the page has changed colors because it has been assigned a class, which gives it a value of 0,1,0. And while this paragaph of the sentence is still in the class,
                <p style="background-color: coral;">this part was given an inline style</p>
            </div>
        </article>

        <article>
            This is another article section, but since there is no class, it reverted back to the two element selectors of body article
        </article>

    </main>


    <footer>
        <p>The footer has inherited the background color of the body element</p>
