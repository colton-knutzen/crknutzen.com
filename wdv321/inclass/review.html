    //switch - case structure special form of multiple if statments

    //three key features of a loop
    //1. loop control variable - control the beginning/ending of a loop
    //2. end condition - know when to end loop as a comparions to the loop control variable
            //conuter control - know how many times we are going to process the loop - for loops
            //sentinel control - do this until some condition applies - while loops
    //3. make sure to update the loop control variable for loop-incrementors, while loop ??

    //1. control variable
    //2. end condition
    //3. updater to loop control variable

        //for(initialize; end condition; update)
            //body of the loop

        for(let i=1; i < 5; i++){
            console.log(x);

        let i = 1;
        while(i<=5){

            //infinte loop - failed to update loop control variable
