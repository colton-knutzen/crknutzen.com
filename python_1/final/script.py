chamber_1_text = "Drip… Drip… Drip… A coldness rolls down your forehead off your face. Your body feels weightless as you hear the sounds of rushing water in the distance. Where am I?"

chamber_2_text = "You open your eyes to see where the droplets falling on your face are coming from above. A small stream flows to the end of splintered marble where gravity pulls them down to you. Sunlight shines through the gaping hole where a roof once was."

chamber_3_text = "You see the Ouránios Ichthýs, or “Sky Fish”, aggressively swimming beyond the clouds. A giant torrent of water is gushing down from the heavens, flooding the land."

chamber_4_text = "You turn your head side-to-side to find debris floating in a pool of water alongside you. This is… my house? Why is water in my living room?"

chamber_5_text = "A splitting headache resurfaces as you stand up in the knee-deep pool. You now realized you were knocked unconscious when the roof collapsed. You’re just happy you landed face up. You see a small, metal circle spark under the clear water. You recognize it as your H.A.L.O; the Holographic Artificial Language Operating device."

chamber_6_text = "Once you get it out and shake it free of loose water, it glows to life and floats before you. “Thank you… I’m sorry, it seems the water damaged some of my memory and I can’t recall your name. What is it again?” \n Note: Try entering numbers, symbols, and spaces with only letters"

chamber_6_text_invalid_name = "“That’s not a real name. Try again.”"

chamber_7_text = "“Thank you {} for saving me from drowning. Even though I don’t breathe because I’m a machine!” \n Note: Use Enter Name Again to play around with the valid or invalid name options"

chamber_8_text = "“Let me check for updates”. The H.A.L.O. spins and flashes as it gathers data. “It seems the Steréōma, or atmosphere, that separates our land from the sea around us, has been punctured. We must escape before ever the clouds are flooded. During my update, I received coordinates for escape pods. They are just up ahead. Let us make haste.”"

chamber_9_text = "Before you, where streets and yards once were, is now an endless stretch of water. 300 meters away you see a platform poking through the surface that leads to a row of stairs. And at the top of the stairs are the remaining escape pods, sparkling with speckles of water underneath the warm, clear sky."

chamber_10_text = "The H.A.L.O. floats alongside. It speaks as you swim against the current. “It seems search and evacuations have already concluded. We’re lucky you woke up when you did.” Between strokes, you look at the pillar of falling water responsible for the destruction of your Polis."

chamber_11_text = "“Álympolis is the collection of 12 Polis in total, each one with its own Steréōma. We’re a nation that lives deep under the sea for crying out loud! These types of apocalypses should be easy for us to handle! But they never are… We’ve already lost so many in past years. This will be number 5…”"

chamber_12_text = "“Once we make it safely to another city, we’re going to find out who did this! You and me together.” You feel the water stir and shake even more from the rising levels. Or maybe it’s something else?"

chamber_13a_text = "You’ve finally reached the platform. As you pull yourself up, you see the sea behind you being to bulge. A giant sea monster with gashing teeth emerges where you were swimming seconds ago. You squirm and roll backwards, as your heart and breathing race to catch up to the sight. “That’s a Leviathamma!”, H.A.L.O. says as the beast falls back into the sea. “Let’s get out of here before it decides to eat the very marble we’re standing on.”"

chamber_13b_text = "The sea below is getting darker and darker with every stroke. You stop and look up, hoping it’s just clouds covering the artificial sun and not another punctured hole. But to your confusion, it’s neither of those… “WATCH OUT!” Before you even have time to register the warning, the gaping mouth of a sea monster swallows you whole. "

chamber_14_text = "“If the Daemons of Amma are here, then we’ve really got to hurry. Even if we decided to wait for rescue, they would have been able to sniff you out far before help could arrive.” You find two paths when you reach the top of the stairs. To the right is a straight path to the Pods. To the left is a destroyed, yet unflooded, house. Maybe you can find some supplies in there."

chamber_15a_text = "You quickly rummage through the scattered belongings while H.A.L.O. keeps watch. Everything that might be of immediate use seems to have been taken already, except for one place. You flip over the mattress to find a gun box underneath. And to your luck, a pistol with three rounds is inside. You load it, flick the safety off, and return to the crossroad."

chamber_15b_text = "You jog forward, keeping a nice pace. Fast enough to move through the streets quickly, but slow enough that you can stay alert to anything moving around. You see it in the corner of your eye as you pass by a house. A black monster, sticking to the side wall. Claws extended, scrapping on the marble as it lunges. You barely have the time to take in a sharp breath. Your last breath. As it tackles you into the adjacent alleyway."

chamber_16_text = "You jog forward at a nice pace. Fast enough to move through the streets quickly, but slow enough to stay highly alert to any movement around. You hear it before you see it. The growling of a curious beast. You turn the corner and see it standing on top of a roof, snout sniffing the air, looking for a meal. You. “Another Leviathamma! Just how many are here already!” You raise the gun as it lets out a howling, before jumping from roof to roof. You take a breath to calm the nerves and steady your aim. Years of training have prepared you for this. Its nasty claws make one final teeth-grinding screech against the marble before leaping. You fire trice. Two in the body and one in the head. The monster falls to the ground before your feet."

chamber_17_text = "“I sure am glad we stopped and found that gun. Let’s continue quickly before more show up. The pod is just ahead.” Sure enough, you reach the escape pods one block later. The water levels have risen substantially. Looking back, you can’t see your house any longer, and the stairs you took after the swim are all but mostly submerged. There isn’t much time left until there will be no land left. "

chamber_18_text = "Quickly, with the help of H.A.L.O. you gain access to operating its interface. PLEASE ENTER PASSWORD:"

chamber_19a_text = "I’M SORRY. THAT PASSWORD IS INCORRECT. SELF-DESTRUCT MODE INITIA- The last thing you hear is a deafening explosion. "

chamber_19b_text = "You see a rickety shack to the side. Do you peak in or attempt the password on your own?"

chamber_20_text = "You peek inside and see a display flashing with the words Today’s Password Is: {}. \n You take your head back out."

chamber_21_text = "PASSWORD ACCEPTED. WELCOME ABOARD. You feel the water splash against your ankles. “Quickly, get in. I’ll start the auto-pilot.” You strap yourself in and close the hatch as a wave splashes the side. H.A.L.O. inserts itself in the designated spot in the console. It lights up in tandem with the rest of the escape pod before you shoot off to another Polis. You peek back to see the shack being consumed by a wave and swimming Leviathamma circling the area you once called home."
