            <h2>Resources to Learn HTML5 & CSS3</h2>

                <h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3 Schools (HTML5)</a></h3>
                    <p>We'll start with the best of the best. This site is simple, easy to navigate, has great use of different colors to help guide user attention, is free, and doesn't have distracting ads in the middle of the articles. It even has interactive code examples that show side-by-side comparisons.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3 Schools (CSS3)</a></h3>
                    <p>The CSS3 version of the above site. Just as simple and easy to understand.</p>
            

                <h3><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Codecademy (Coding Bootcamp)</a></h3>  
                    <p>One of the many ways to learn to code is through a Coding Bootcamp. These are fast-paced, one to two-day seminars, that jam an entire semester's worth of content in a short time. I haven't done much research on these, but my initial thoughts are they are bad for beginners because it's easy to get left behind or forget vital foundations that next day, but could be a fast refresher for returning coders or those that want to learn a new, similar, language. They also seem a little predatory in their whole "Learn to code today, get a development job making professional websites tomorrow," mentality.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc ">Youtube Tutorials</a></h3>
                    <p>In a similar vein of a Coding Camp is learning through a video guide series. These are typically free of charge, and the individual has the option to stop and review as frequently as needed, but the quality is something to look out for.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_color_code_builder.htm">Tutorials Point</a></h3>
                    <p>A free website similar to W3 Schools, but it comes short in a few ways. There are ads smack in the middle of articles, which makes the learning process jarring and less fluid. There is a lot of wasted space. And they fail to use a variety of colors for contrast, which makes navigation less intuitive.</p>
            
                <h3><a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/">Tutorial Republic (HTML5)</a></h3>
                    <p>This website seems like a good middle ground between W3 Schools and Tutorial Point. It's more intuitive, but there is still a lot of wasted space and there seems to be less content overall.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/">Tutorial Republic (CSS3)</a></h3>
                    <p>The CSS3 verison of the above site.</p>
