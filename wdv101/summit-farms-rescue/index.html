                <p>Summit Farms is recognized for rescuing Alaskan dog breeds such as Malamutes and Huskies. Our mission
                    is
                    to
                    adopt and save as many dogs as we can.</p>

                <p>We believe in helping the helpless and reducing the number of homeless dogs while improving the
                    welfare
                    of all domestic animals. Additionally, we seek to educate our community on the plight of these
                    animals.
                </p>

                <p> Brad and Janet Harker founded Summit Farms Rescue in 2004. We work to foster Respect, Understanding
                    and
                    Compassion for all creatures, and the belief that all life is valuable and worthy of protection.</p>

                <p> Since the founding of Summit Farms, we have adopted more than 2,620 dogs and counting.</p>

                <p>We are grateful for the continued support of our donners. We are overjoyed to have so many huskies
                    have
                    new
                    forever homes with caring families. Should you have any questions, please feel free to visit our
