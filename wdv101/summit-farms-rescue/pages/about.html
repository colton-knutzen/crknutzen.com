            </h2>
                <p>Alaskan Husky's are medium-sized dogs and the most common breed for sled dog racing. Their color of
                coat can range from white, black, brown, and any mix-match with spots. This bred values speed over strength.</p>

            <h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2>

                <p>Alaskan Malamute are a larger breed and thus known for their strengh and endurance when it comes to pulling heavy loads. They have a thick coat to get them warm in the cold enviornments, but that means more sheading than other breeds. They are identified by their fluffy, upwards pointing, question mark-shaped tail.</p>

            <h2>Alaskan Klee Kai</h2>

                <p>The Alaskan Klee Kai is a bred breed that comes in a variety of sizes ranging from 5-22 pounds. They were bred to resemble the sled dog style, but to be more of a companion and less of a work dog.</p>

            <h2>American Eskimo Dog</h2>

                <p>The American Eskimo is another companion breed rather than work dog. They come in three sizes, but are typically smaller than the Alaskan Klee Kai. They have a thick, almost round white coat that is extra soft to the touch. They even have a bit of wolf in them!</p>

            <div class="clearfix">
            <h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
                <div class="bottompic"><img src="../images/snow-dog.jpg" alt="dog sitting in snow with branch"></div>
                <p>The Siberian Husky is one of the most well known northern bred of dog. They are similar to the Alaskan Husky, but are generally smaller. They have a thick double coat and tall triangular ears.</p>
             
            <h2>Samoyed</h2>

                <p>Samoyed dogs are of the medium size and preform better with herding tasks rather than sled-pulling. They are typically white with a thick, poffy coat.</p>

            <h2>Greenland</h2>

                <p>The Greenland dog is another large, sled-pull breed. This breed gets it's name from their home; Greenland. Which considers them a national treasure. They love them so much the government chips and registers every Greenland dog, and it's even illegal to import other dog breeds in!</p>
