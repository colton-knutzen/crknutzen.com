                Diet

            </h2>

            <p>Since most Alaskan dog breeds are works dogs, having a highly-nutritious, well-packed diet is essential
                to a long, healthy life. You'll want to find a blend that is not only bred-specific, but also age and
                season specific. They will burn more calories in the winter to stay warm and also because that is
                typically their busiest part of the year if they are a work dog. But in the summer, you won't want to
                overfed them when there is more downtime.</p>

            <h2>Work</h2>

            <p>Like the old saying goes, "A happy dog is a working dog," and it's true! Dogs are just like people, and
                enjoy being helpful and finding meaningful work. Alaskan dogs are strong, fast, and an easily trainable
                breed, which makes them perfect for sledding and pulling in snowy enviornments. Properly training and
                raising them is escially to their care. Take the Greenland dog for example. This is a bred that is free
                to roam and explore during their puppyhood, but when they reach adulthood they are trained to be
                contributing members of their society.</p>

                <p>Alaskan dogs must stay warm in frigided enviornements. And to do that they have thick, double-coated
                    fur. Keeping their fur knot free and smooth will improve your dogs happiness as well as your own.
                    During the summer they will shed some of it off, so managing it throughout the year will alleviate
                    the yearly mess.</p>
