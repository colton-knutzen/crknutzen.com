            <h3>Wind Energy in Iowa</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Wind turbines covert kinetic energy, produced from the wind moving their blades, into electrical energy</li>
                <li>The turbines in Iowa are around 26 stories tall</li>
                <li>Each turbine weights around 57 tons, with each of it's three blades around 8,000 pounds</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia on Wind Energy in Iowa:
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Iowa">
                    <strong><em>Making up over 55% of the state's generated electricity in 2021, wind power is the largest source of electricity generation in Iowa.</em></strong> 
                </blockquote>
            </p>    

            <p>
                The state had hopes to achieve <em>only</em> 40% by 2020, but we reached that by late 2019 and sailed past that goal by 2020. 2 years ago, Iowa have over 5,500 functioning wind turbines throughout the state, which has lead to it's great sucess.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hancock county has a large precentage of the state's turbines.

            <p>
                As you can see, Iowa is the <strong>leading</strong> state when it comes to wind power.
